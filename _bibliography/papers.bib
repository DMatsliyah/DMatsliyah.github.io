  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

	abstract = {Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a pivotal mechanism driving bacterial evolution, conferring adaptability within dynamic marine ecosystems. Among HGT mechanisms, conjugation mediated by Type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) plays a central role in the ecological success of marine bacteria. However, the triggers initiating conjugation events in the marine environment are not well understood. Roseobacters, abundant marine bacteria commonly associated with algae, possess a multitude of plasmids encoding T4SSs. Many Roseobacters are heterotrophic bacteria that rely on algal secreted compounds for supporting bacterial growth. Algal compounds therefore attract bacteria and promote colonization, including attachment to algal cells. Bacterial proximity, cell-to-cell contact, and attachment, can all foster HGT. Hence, we hypothesized that algal exudates, acting as chemoattractants for bacteria, may function as cues promoting bacterial HGT. Examination of various Roseobacters demonstrated that the genomic location of the T4SS impacts its functionality; a bacterial strain harboring a chromosomal-encoded T4SS does not perform conjugation, while a strain of the same species carrying a plasmid-encoded T4SS exhibits functional conjugation capability. Subsequently, we probed the influence of algal exudates on bacterial conjugation dynamics. Our findings revealed that algal exudates enhance plasmid transfer through conjugation but do not modulate the transcription of the conjugative machinery genes. These observations suggest that the bacterial responses to algal hosts evolved to correlate with an increased likelihood of encountering compatible partners for successful conjugation. Furthermore, since specific algae attract distinct bacterial populations, algae influence potential partners for genetic exchange and may shape the trajectory of bacterial evolution in the marine environment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
