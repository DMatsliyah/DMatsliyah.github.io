This project is an M.Sc research project that was part of my masters' thesis, I was under the supervision of Dr. Einat Segev and have also been mentored by PhD student Yemima Duchin Rapp, in the Plant & Environmental Sciences department of the Weizmann Institute of Science. Parts of my work were featured in [this recent paper which was submitted not long ago](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.567099v2) so I won't be expanding too much on that here, but I will be giving some context and introduction before diving into the data analysis driven portion of the project. Also feel free to skip ahead to the '' section to get right into the data.

Graph 3: A panel of graphs showing the sea level (blue) and its change (red) in meters. Each graph displays data from the winter of each year between 2009 and 2015. The data shown is from October to March every year, except for the winter of 2010/2011 where there was no data between January and March. Unusual changes in the panel indicate storms and extreme events.

Map 1: Areas that may be affected by sea level rise in the west of Emek Hefer. Map based on SRTM raster data[9]. Areas colored in orange represent areas that will be damaged by sea level rise of up to 0.5 meters. Areas colored in red represent areas that will be damaged by sea level rise of up to 1 meter.
