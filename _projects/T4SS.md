This project is an M.Sc research project that was part of my masters' thesis, I was under the supervision of Dr. Einat Segev and have also been mentored by PhD student Yemima Duchin Rapp, in the Plant & Environmental Sciences department of the Weizmann Institute of Science. 

Parts of my work were featured [in a very recent paper which was submitted not long ago](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.11.14.567099v2). Therefore I'll give brief context and introduction before diving into the data analysis driven portion of the project. 

Also feel free to skip ahead to the '' section to get right into the data. Or contact me if you'd wish to further discuss the biology. :nerd_face:
