Global warming is a phenomenon driven by various interrelated anthropogenic and biogeochemical factors[^1]. A significant contributor to this warming is the emission of greenhouse gases and their accumulation in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affects the flux of solar radiation on Earth, influencing factors such as surface temperature, precipitation, humidity, and sea level.</p> <p>The primary cause of sea level rise is the expansion of water due to an increase in temperature, causing water molecules to move apart. Additionally, the melting of continental glaciers contributes to this rise[^2][^3]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an international body composed of researchers, publishes periodic reports that constitute a consensus on the Earth’s climate situation. The 2014 IPCC report presented forecasts suggesting that the sea level will rise between 25-82 cm in the next hundred years[^4].</p> <p>In Israel, the consequences of rising sea levels extend beyond flooding, encompassing dangers such as seawater intrusion into groundwater, sand erosion, and cliff collapse. These events are expected to become more frequent due to the increased frequency of extreme weather events resulting from global warming[^5]. As the population near the coast continues to grow, the number of potential victims is expected to rise each year. Beyond direct property damage, coastal activities such as water desalination may be harmed, affecting both civilians and industries far from the coast. Studies also indicate potential damage and disruption to various anchorages and ports due to the rise of sea levels[^6][^7].</p> <p>Hence, this research seeks to answer the question, ‘What is the effect of sea level rise on the coasts of Israel?’</p> <h3>Materials and Methods</h3> <p>To conduct this research, data and models were collected from several official sources. Data regarding global sea water levels, obtained through satellite measurements, were downloaded from the NASA website, the American space agency known for its monitoring and research in various fields[^1]. Advanced satellites enable the measurement of various parameters, such as sea level, recorded by NASA satellites since 1993. Satellite altimetry is recognized as a high-quality technique for measuring Earth’s sea level with a high degree of accuracy.</p> <p>Historical sea level change data and reliable forecasts were extracted from the latest IPCC report in 2014[^4]. As mentioned in the introduction, the IPCC is considered a reliable source of data on this subject. This study presents data from both the strictest and most lenient models from the report to offer a comprehensive picture.</p> <p>For a comprehensive assessment of the situation on the coasts of Israel, particularly in extreme situations such as storms, sea level data from the Israel Mapping Office (MPI) for the years 1996 to 2020 were downloaded[^8]. The MPI is a government body responsible for sea level measurements, taken automatically every five minutes at various stations along the country’s coasts. These measurements use level gauges calibrated to an elevation point in the national balance network, ensuring the reliability of the collected data. To address variations in reporting among stations, a combination of data from Tel Aviv, Jaffa, and Ashdod coastal stations was used due to their proximity and representativeness.</p> <p>During the data processing phase, which involved approximately 2.4 million lines of map measurements, the RStudio software was employed. The attached code in the appendix outlines the steps taken during this phase. Two steps for sea level rise (0.5 and 1 meter) were determined from this data and will be presented on the map.</p> <p>To facilitate spatial analysis, raster layers from SRTM, a high-quality source providing data from NASA satellites that have been analyzed and processed to improve quality and fill gaps, were downloaded[^9]. However, challenges arose in distinguishing between individual centimeters due to the resolution of the raster. To address this, an additional raster focused on the fishing trawl area, derived from the map provided by Dr. Suari, was utilized. This raster is expected to provide higher resolution due to point mapping.</p> <p>Digitization tools and the Raster Calculator tool in QGIS software were employed to extract specific elevation areas from the rasters, later colored for visual illustration. The study is concentrated on the fishing trawler area and Haifa Bay.</p> <p>To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:</p> <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>---
