HGT, through mechanisms like Transformation, Transduction, Gene Transfer Agents, and Conjugation, empowers bacteria to acquire new capabilities for symbiosis, antibiotic resistance, metabolic activity, and pathogenicity.<sup id="fnref:trans" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:trans" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p> <p>A central mechanism for HGT is the <strong>type IV secretion system (T4SS)</strong>, facilitating <strong>cell-to-cell contact and genetic material transfer</strong>. Many bacteria possess T4SS on plasmids or chromosomes, impacting their functionality. In the environmentally crucial Roseobacter group, T4SS genes vary in genomic locations, raising questions about their functional impact.<sup id="fnref:t4ss" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:t4ss" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p> <p>Conjugation, a form of HGT, is suggested to contribute significantly to the ecological success of Roseobacters, known for diverse metabolic capabilities and symbiotic interactions, especially with algal hosts.

This proximity supports nutrient flux for planktonic bacteria. <strong>Algal exudates impact bacterial physiology and interactions</strong>, promoting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) through bacterial proximity and attachment. Our study explores Roseobacter conjugation in the ecological context of the algal host <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em>. We utilized Roseobacter species identified in algal samples, testing their ability to conduct conjugation and examining the influence of T4SS genomic location. Additionally, we investigated the impact of algal exudates on bacterial conjugation, focusing on T4SS-encoding gene expression and DNA transfer.<sup id="fnref:exudates" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:exudates" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p> <p>This study explored Roseobacter conjugation in the context of an algal host, using <em>Emiliania huxleyi</em>.

Surprisingly, expression of plasmid-encoded T4SS genes did not increase in response to algal exudates, yet conjugation efficiency and plasmid transfer improved. This suggests a connection between bacterial response to an algal host and an increased likelihood of successful conjugation. <strong><em>The difference in functionality of a plasmid-encoded, or a chromosomally encoded T4SS sparked my interest and led to the project I’m going to show you now!</em></strong></p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehux-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehux-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehux-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehux.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Emiliania huxleyi" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/PIrosette-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/PIrosette-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/PIrosette-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/PIrosette.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Phaeobacter inhibens bacteria form beautiful rosettes" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehuxPinhibens-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehuxPinhibens-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehuxPinhibens-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/ehuxPinhibens.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Phaeobacter inhibens attached to an Emiliania huxleyi cell" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> On the left, Emiliania huxleyi, an abundant coccolithophore in modern oceans.

This sharing, called Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), helps them adapt to different challenges.</p> <p>Now, <strong>one way bacteria share information is through something called the type IV secretion system (T4SS)</strong>. It’s like a tiny delivery system that allows bacteria to pass on their instruction manuals to other bacteria nearby. Some bacteria have this system on <strong>small circular structures called plasmids</strong>, while others have it in their <strong>main instruction manual (chromosome)</strong>.</p> <p>In a specific group of bacteria called <em>Roseobacters</em>, we found that the T4SS genes are in different places in their instruction manuals. One interesting thing about Roseobacters is their interactions with algae, like tiny plant-like organisms in the ocean. <strong>These bacteria benefit from the nutrients that algae release, helping them grow</strong>. The study looked at how these bacteria interact with algae, focusing on the T4SS.</p> <p>We tested different Roseobacter species to see how they share information, and found that the T4SS on plasmids works well, while the one on the chromosome (main instruction manual) doesn’t work as effectively.</p> <p>Surprisingly, the bacteria’s response to algae didn’t make the T4SS on plasmids work better, but the <strong>bacteria still shared information more efficiently</strong>. This suggests that the way bacteria react to algae somehow helps them share their instruction manuals better.</p> <p>So, this study explored how bacteria, specifically Roseobacters, share information in the context of their interaction with algae. <strong><em>The differences in how the plasmid and main instruction manual versions of T4SS work caught the our attention and inspired the project I’m showing next.</em></strong></p> <h3 id="defining-a-research-question-and-approach">Defining a research question and approach</h3> <p>Seeing as there’s a functional difference between these systems depending on their encoding location, we defined our research question as <strong><em>“What is the difference between chromosomally or plasmid encoded T4SS and can it explain conjugation ability”</em></strong>’</p> <p>We began approaching this question experimentally and planned designs of several mutant strains, however, technical difficulties and time limits of my studies made us recalculate and I’ve decided to move on with a <strong>bioinformatic approach</strong>, focusing on <strong>data analysis</strong> in order to address the question on a <strong>larger scale</strong> by collecting data from numerous bacterial strains.

We started by mapping out all the relevant genes associated with our system on <a href="https://www.genome.jp/kegg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">KEGG</a>. Next, we produced function profiles listing the number of copies of each gene per bacterial scaffold using <a href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/mer/main.cgi" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JGI’s IMG/MER database</a> and matching with the unique IDs we previously gathered.

You can tell there’s lots of variance in the gene distribution, clearly <strong>most systems are encoded on plasmids</strong>.

Some suggest they’re essential, while others argue they’re dispensable. However the functions they’re said to perform <strong>may be critical for conjugation</strong>. Given these extreme findings, I questioned the validity of the data.

Two copies of the system are encoded on <strong>two different plasmids</strong> of strain <strong>P72</strong> (A &amp; B in the figure below), while only one copy exists on the <strong>chromosome of DSM-17395</strong> (C in the figure below).</p> <p>The first thing I noticed when I looked at the gene layout of P72 was there were so many <strong>hypothetical proteins!</strong> is one of them our missing <strong><em>VirB1 or VirB7?</em></strong></p> <p>To those of you that are not biologists, a hypothetical protein means these are proteins that are <strong>predicted</strong> to be expressed in an organism, but so far there’s no evidence of their existence.

Conversely, <strong>up to 18 genomes share a single pOTU</strong>, in other words, there are groups of bacteria, with the largest group having 18 bacteria, that have the same plasmid OTU! This may not be <em>exactly</em> the same plasmid, but <strong>evolutionarily speaking they’re as close as it gets!</strong> this suggests enhanced HGT potential within this plasmids.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/uniquePOTUplot-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/uniquePOTUplot-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/uniquePOTUplot-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/uniquePOTUplot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Unique pOTUs abundance in Roseobacters" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Unique pOTUs abundance in Roseobacters.

The mis-annotation of certain genes, such as virB1 and virB7, highlighted the challenges in studying these systems, emphasizing the need for precise genetic data. Furthermore, our comparative analysis of chromosomal and plasmid encoded T4SS sequences shed light on distinctive patterns, further underscoring the uniqueness of these systems. And suggesting that plasmid encoded T4SS in Roseobacters is active in context of conjugation, while chromosomally encoded T4SS is not, although it requires further confirmation.</p> <p>Although certain questions remain, particularly regarding the evolutionary scenarios and the precise roles of specific proteins, this study lays a foundation for future investigations in understanding the complex interplay between algae and bacterial conjugation within the Roseobacter group.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-7 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/comics.jfif-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/comics.jfif-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/comics.jfif-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/projects/t4ss/comics.jfif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="Bacteria performing conjugation.
